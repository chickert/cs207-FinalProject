
# About
This directory contains the implementation of ARRRtomatic diff. See the docs folder (https://github.com/pirates-of-the-SEAS/cs207-FinalProject/blob/master/docs/documentation.ipynb) for more detail on how to install, setup, and use.

Our implementation includes auto_diff.py which contains the AutoDiff, AutoDiffVector, AutoDiffRev, and AutoDiffRevVector classes as well as the functions and optimization subpackages. 

functions contains elementary unary operations (sin, exp, etc.) for building the computational graph.

optimization contains several optimization routines using our automatic differentiation implementation.
