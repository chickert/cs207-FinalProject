    "Our software package is an automatic differentiation suite that solves the problem of exactly computing the derivative (to machine precision) for an arbitrary function as long as that function can be expressed as the composition of elementary functions. Precise computation of the gradient is of fundamental importance in the sciences and applied mathematics. Many optimization algorithms rely on gradient information. Indeed, the backpropagation algorithm, which is used to train neural networks, is simply gradient descent on the network's weights. Derivatives are also used in root finding methods such as Newton's method, which are used to numerically solve ordinary differential equations when using implicit methods, among other things. Reliable solutions to ODEs are integral to many of the applied sciences. Automatic differentiation offers an improvement over finite difference methods in that automatic differentiation is exact to machine precision and does not suffer nearly as much from numerical stability issues. AD is also better than symbolic differentiation in that it is less computationally expensive."

    "#### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of current implementation. This section goes deeper than the high level software organization section.\n",
    "Try to think about the following:\n",
    "Core data structures\n",
    "Core classes\n",
    "Important attributes\n",
    "External dependencies\n",
    "Elementary functions\n",
    "This is similar to what you did for Milestone 1, but now you've actually implemented it.\n",
    "What aspects have you not implemented yet? What else do you plan on implementing?\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on implementing the forward mode of automatic differentiation through operator overloading and defining custom functions for cases where operator overloading does not make sense (i.e. exp, sin, etc.). That is, for each of the elementary operations (add, subtract, etc.), we will overload the appropriate dunder method in our core auto diff variable class. Note that for each of the elementary operations, this also includes overloading the reverse operands (`__rmul__`, `__radd__`, etc.). The overloaded methods will appropriately update both the value and all the partial derivatives. We will account only for the real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our core data structure will be a representation of a particular row in the trace table, which in turn corresponds to a step in the computational graph. Users will instantiate named variables that represent root nodes in the computational graph (which corresponds to the inputs to the *n* initial rows of the trace table, where *n* represents the number of input variables). Users will then be able to create arbitrarily complicated functions by manipulating these variables with elementary operations. At every step the package will be able to output the derivative and the function value. Once the user has finished composing a function, our package's output will then be the final derivatives and function value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be implemented via the AutoDiffVariable class, which will handle all of the operator overloading. AutoDiffVariable objects can be combined through elementary operations to yield a new AutoDiffVariable object that has the appropriate value and partial derivatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "The AutoDiffVariable class will expose a few methods, namely get_named_variables, get_value, and get_gradient. The user will access get_gradient when they have finished writing their computational graph. As for attributes, the AutoDiffVariable class will simply maintain the names of its variables as well as a dictionary which contains the value of the function and its partial derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use NumPy for elementary computations. Beyond benefitting our package with its speed and versatility, NumPy's prevalence among the Python programming community will allow those interested to more easily understand how our packages operates \"under the hood,\" especially to understand which operators we have overloaded.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond NumPy, our package will not have other external dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create additional modules for each elementary function. Each module will contain a function that will update an AutoDiffVariable object accordingly. For example, \"f = adfuncs.exp(x)\" would exponentiate the value and then multiply each partial derivative by the new exponentiated value. The variable \"f\" would then point to that updated value. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect this approach to be robust enough to handle vector valued functions with vector inputs. We envision creating convenience methods if a user wishes to work in a multivariate setting (i.e. we'll create convenience classes to create vectors of AutoDiffVariables and allow for broadcasting operations on iterables of AutoDiffVariable objects)."

    "#### Future Features \n",
    "\n",
<<<<<<< HEAD
    "##### Vector valued functions\n",
    "We plan to extend our current implementation to be able to handle vector valued functions. We will do so by creating a convenience class, AutoDiffVector, that takes a collection of AutoDiff objects and supports broadcasting operations (i.e. scalar operations or vector arithmetic when performing algebraic operations with other AutoDiffVector objects). This class will perform the bookkeeping that keeps track of all of the variables across each function and will also have convenience methods for accessing the Jacobian. We expect that this addition will entail adding a new class to auto_diff.py and the software structure will otherwise not change. Possible challeneges include figuring out design considerations such as whether we will want the AutoDiffVector's dimensions to be mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from ARRRtomatic_diff import AutoDiff, AutoDiffVector\n",
    "from ARRRtomatic_diff.functions import sin, exp, sqrt\n",
    "\n",
    "x = AutoDiff(name='x', val=-1)\n",
    "y = AutoDiff(name='y', val=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "u = AutoDiffVector((x,y))\n",
    "v = AutoDiffVector((-y,x))\n",
    "\n",
    "# performs vector addition, scalar multiplication, and broadcasts the \n",
    "# unary operator sin element-wise\n",
    "z = sin(5*(u + v))\n",
    "\n",
    "# a numpy array representnug the Jacobian of the vector-valued function\n",
    "# f1 = x - y\n",
    "# f2 = y + x\n",
    "J = z.get_jacobian() \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Newton's method\n",
    "We plan to implement Newton's method and possibly other root finding / optimization routines such as SGD (and the special case of backpropagation), time permitting. for an arbitrary vector valued function. We will do so by creating a subpackage, optimization, which will contain modules that implement the optimization routines via functions. For Newton's Method, we will compute the Jacobian/derivative through our AutoDiffVector/AutoDiff objects and use numpy to solve the linear system in the multivariate setting. We do not foresee many challenges in implementing newton's method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from ARRRtomatic_diff import AutoDiff\n",

    "from ARRRtomatic_diff.optimization import newton\n",

    "    x = AutoDiff(name='x', val=x)\n",
    "\n",
    "    auto_diff_results = sin(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return auto_diff_results['val'], auto_diff_results['d_x']\n",
    "    \n",
    "do_newtons_method(0.2, f, verbose=1)\n",
    "Iteration 1 | x: 0.200000 | f(x): 0.198669 | deriv: 0.980067\n",
    "Iteration 2 | x: -0.002710 | f(x): -0.002710 | deriv: 0.999996\n",
    "Converged to 6.634450606078646e-09 after 3 iterations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reverse mode\n",
    "We plan to implement the reverse mode as an alternative to forward mode. We will do so by creating another AutoDiff class, AutoDiffRev, and the corresponding reverse AutoDiffVector, AutoDiffVectorRev. The API will be mostly the same - the computational graph will be explicitly constructed via algebraically combining AutoDiffRev variables. The intermediate forward pass values and partials will be calculated through these operations as well as the graph dependency structure. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from ARRRtomatic_diff import AutoDiffRev\n",
    "\n",
    "x = Var(1)\n",
    "y = Var(2)\n",
    "z = x * y\n",
    "z.partial = 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "print(z.value)\n",
    "print(x.partial)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the multiplication of x and y keeps track of the forward pass evaluations and immediate partials and also specifies z as a child node of x and y in the dependency graph. Each AutoDiffRev variable will keep track of the operations that it's used in. Unlike our forward mode implementation, dz/dx and dz/dy are maintained in the x and y variables, so they must be kept around. The computation of the partial derivatives of the output with respect to the input is performed recursively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenges to implementing reverse mode will be making the API elegant for the vector-valued case, working with a different mental model for automatic differentiation, and making our reverse mode implementation work with our optimization routines. Our implementation of reverse mode will require adding two additioanl classes, AutoDiffRev and AutoDiffVectorRev to auto_diff.py. We do not expect to add any new modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Checks to ensure that variables of the same name have the same initial value\n",
    "Currently, we have a rudimentary check to verify that user isn't attempting to combine two AutoDiff variables that have the same named variable but with differing values. It's still possible for a user to create an AutoDiff object with a named variable, perform operations on it, and then combing it with another AutoDiff object with the same named variable but with a different value. We plan to make our software throw an exception when this happens. This will require modifying AutoDiff to keep track of the initial values for each variable and then perform a check when attempting to combine two AutoDiff objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from ARRRtomatic_diff import AutoDiff\n",
    "from ARRRtomatic_diff.functions import sin\n",

    "x1 + x2\n",
    "\n",
    "# does not throw an exception but should\n",
