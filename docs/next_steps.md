Now that you've got most of the hard implementation work done, what kinds of things do you want to impelement next? 

How will your software change? 

What will be the primary challenges to implementing these new features? 

Things you may want to consider here include (but are not limited to) 
changes to the directory structure
new modules
new classes 
new data structures


# Vector valued functions
We plan to extend our current implementation to be able to handle 

```python
```

# Newton's method
We plan to implement newton's method for an arbitrary vector valued function. We will do so by obtaining the Jacobian through our 

# Reverse mode
